# IBC Nameservice

A simple mapping with implied graph edges to show equality of different IBC Denoms related to their underlying Base Denom. This is intended to be controlled by a multisig or a DAO on a chain as a public good, so that smart contracts and projects can query this to establish whether or not IBC Denoms are the same.

This could of course be done at native level as well, this is just a simplified, curated address book.

If you built a UI, you might want to make the lookup and breakdown of IBC Denom and Base Denom for saving completely automatic.
